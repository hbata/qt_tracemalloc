TODO list
=========

Important:

- dialog to open a snapshot file
- contextual menu: copy filename/line/traceback, open line in an editor
- support "all_frames=False" filter (search a filename anywhere in the
  traceback, not only in the most recent frame)

Minor:

- configurable filters
- display the traceback limit

Later:

- annotate the source code: how many bytes were allocated
  (with red color for largest allocations ;-))
- tracemalloc_wrapper.py: collect RSS memory and tracemalloc current/peak
  memory every 5 seconds, take snapshots every 60 seconds
- graphics to show the evolution of (total) memory many snapshots
- more charts?
- "process bar" to display the "%Total" column to see immediatly the
  lines allocating the most memroy
